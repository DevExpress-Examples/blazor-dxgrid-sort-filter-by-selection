# Blazor Grid â€” Sort and Filter Data by Selection

Users need to quickly review and process key records when they work with large datasets. Sorting and filtering by selected rows help with high-priority tasks, flagged emails, and VIP customers. In this example, the [DevExpress Blazor Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403143/components/grid) component brings selected rows to the top or displays only those rows.

## Implementation Details

To filter [DevExpress Blazor Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403143/components/grid) by selected rows, assign [SelectedDataItems](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.SelectedDataItems) to the [Data](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.Data) property. To sort grid data by selection, create a service column as follows:

1. Add an [invisible](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridColumn.Visible) column to the Grid component.
2. Set the column's [FieldName](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridDataColumn.FieldName) to a unique value not present in the bound data source.
3. Set the column's [UnboundType](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridDataColumn.UnboundType) to a value other than `Bound`.
4. Set the column's [SortMode](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGridDataColumn.SortMode) property to `Custom`.
5. Handle the Grid's [CustomSort](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/DevExpress.Blazor.DxGrid.CustomSort) event. In the event handler, compare rows by their selection state.

Now, service column sorting brings selected rows to the top.
